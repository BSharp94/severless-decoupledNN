# Severless Decoupled NN Using Delayed Gradients

8/28/19
Current this project is used to test the accuracy of neural networks with delayed gradient updates. We aim to prove two key points:

1. Delayed gradient updates can produce models with the competitive accuracy
2. Delayed gradients reach a global minimum relativly the same number of iterations

## Files 
* main.py - normal alexnet implementation of mnist dataset run over 10 epochs
* main2.py - Delayed Gradient updates added to alexnet implementation of mnist dataset run over 10 epochs

## Current Results

Control 

    - 99.0814% test accuracy over 10 epochs
